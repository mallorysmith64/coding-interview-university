## Asymptotic Notation

It's all about that runtime length:

1) Linear time complexity = O(n) = runtime will grow linearly with the input size
Ex: counting characters in a string one by one

2) Constant time complexity = O(1) = runtime is the same regardless of input size
Ex: predefined string length, you know how many chars there are

3) Quadratic time complexity = O(n^2) = runtime grows quadratically with input size
Ex: over time can slowdown program unless the input is really small, then it could work faster, think of a quadratic function vs a linear function's graph

4) Logarithmic time complexity = O(log n) = runtime grows to the logarithm of the input size
Ex: runtime grows very slowly compared to the input size, think of halving or the logarithm graph

## Big O Notation

I personally didn't get anything from this video. In summary, he was explaining big o notation using Java.
